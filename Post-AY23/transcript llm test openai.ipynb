Given the time that we're in with Coronavirus and a pandemic, the notes that they give and the socially distanced posture that we've just seen during the short service are stark reminders of present day, aren't they?You probably noticed, as I did, that the social distance was filled with beautiful voices, filling the spaces between them and all of us on this day. March 7th, 1965, a route across the bridge 1200 feet would begin to change America. House minority whip Steve Scalise with me now as we watch this procession. Congressman, you're with me?\n",

And John Lewis, the life he lived is a life that can be -- that we put on display to all generations.And they were saying, you know, he's talking about nonviolence and love and peace, and particularly some of the anarchists, very few of them were in there, but most of them were good and decent people. But many of them were trying to suggest to the crowd something that would be antithetical to what John Lewis had always preached.And I thank God that right now, if you look at the marches and the demonstrations that are continuing, they're here in Kansas City, a city you know quite well, the crowds in some instances were as much as 75 percent white.

      " What an unbelievable difference he made and what an honor it was for me to be able to serve with him and to get to know John Lewis. He was a legend. He was a giant of the civil rights movement. And you knew that when you walked into the Capitol for the first time and you look at some of the people that you get to serve with. And yet, John was incredibly approachable.John was such a warm person, and he really did believe in sharing that history. He invited members on a regular basis to go to Selma with him. And I was able to do that in 2016. In fact, my colleague (Inaudible) that just gave those wonderful remarks. We started off at that Brown AME Church, the church where Martin Luther King Jr. would give so many passionate speeches from the pulpit, where John helped organize with other SCLC leaders.The student non-violent coordinating committee which John was the head of, they would meet there at the church. And then ultimately, that day of bloody Sunday, we marched that same route in 2016. And I was honored to be arm in arm with him. And, you know, Harris, as we were walking the long walk, you turn left on Broad Street and you see the Edmund Pettis Bridge.And it just strikes you because I know the history of what happened to John that day. He was brutally beaten crossing that bridge, but he knew what was ahead of him. And yet, he knew that he had to blaze that trail so that others could blaze bigger trails. And as we started down that road and you're looking at the bridge and I'm arm in arm with John, he starts pointing out landmarks.And he said, you know, that's where this group used to meet. And that's where they started organizing against us. And he just remembered that history as if it was yesterday, and he relived it because he wanted others to know that  history as well. And just seeing that history and understanding how far we've come and how far we still want to go as a nation. We've gotten so many of those miles because of great giants like John Lewis.\n",

I don't think there's any question that in some ways, you know, Black Americans have been the most patriotic. They talked about during World War II the double V, victory abroad against the Nazis, the imperialists, the fascists, but then victory here at home in terms of achieving the visions, the aspiration that you can find in the declaration of independence, that all men are created equal.And John Lewis really stood up to that principle and did so in a nonviolent manner as Steve Harrigan reminded us when he crossed that bridge on foot right next to Hosea Williams from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. What you saw was a man with his hands in his pocket even as the Major John Cloud of the Alabama state troopers advanced with violence, with sticks, and with smoke bombs and the like.John Lewis was a nonviolent man standing up for American principle and American justice in America, saying to all, we have a right to vote in this democracy.\n",

And it's interesting for people who have covered a lot of the protests since Ferguson, Missouri, on and the violence in those protests.We've heard John Lewis described today as a fighter and someone who got in the ring. But those protests when you go back and look at some of the black and white footage which changed America, they are simply astounding because they were violent, but in most cases the violence where John Lewis was involved were on one side. When he comes down that Pettus Bridge, when he pauses there, his hands are in his pockets.He knows what's coming. So there is violence there. But there is also on the other side a real commitment, a deep commitment to non-violence as well.\n",

But there are people who, for example, crossed that bridge with John Lewis on that day and were beaten. And so on one side, there are people who are saying, you know, you change it to another name that would reflect all the people who went across the bridge.Those of us in Congress would like to see John Lewis serve as the example of the people, as a representative of the people who crossed that bridge and who were also beaten that day like Hosea Williams.But, you know, John Lewis, I can tell you without fear or contradiction, never, ever, ever participated in the conversations that were occurring all around him about naming that bridge after him. He was just not that kind of a guy. In fact, John was shy. He probably never would be able to call it the John Lewis Bridge if he were alive to see that happen.Terri Sewell, Representative Terri Sewell from Alabama, for example, she wants it to be named John Lewis. And I think there's going to be probably some back and forth in that community. But ultimately, I think that the name of the bridge is going to change. Hopefully, it can be changed to John Lewis.

They talked about during World War II the double V, victory abroad against the Nazis, the imperialists, the fascists, but then victory here at home in terms of achieving the visions, the aspiration that you can find in the declaration of independence, that all men are created equal.And John Lewis really stood up to that principle and did so in a nonviolent manner as Steve Harrigan reminded us when he crossed that bridge on foot right next to Hosea Williams from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. What you saw was a man with his hands in his pocket even as the Major John Cloud of the Alabama state troopers advanced with violence, with sticks, and with smoke bombs and the like.John Lewis was a nonviolent man standing up for American principle and American justice in America, saying to all, we have a right to vote in this democracy.\n",

      " Yeah, you remind us of those very important moments, those decisions that John Lewis was making constantly to be non-violent, to keep his hands in his pockets, as you so eloquently remind us of, Steve Harrigan. Steve, I know that you will be standing by for us. Let's listen more to this, and then we will bring in the Representative, Emmanuel Cleaver. Stay close.As we watch this procession getting ready to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge with John Lewis. Just a few words about what we're watching. A funeral caisson is a two-wheeled horse-drawn cart originally used to take ammunition during -- to military battles, and when necessary, to transport the wounded or dead from the battlefield.Having grown up military, I can tell you that caissons that bury casket they usually appear during state funerals or during the cemetery procession for a member of the armed forces who's received full military honors for a funeral. And so the significance in all of all of this is the service of Congressman John Lewis, both as a civil rights leader and then serving in Congress and the significance of this also is to show how greatly he changed America.You've heard Representative Steve Scalise moments ago who joined me who talked about how we became a better, more perfect union, a better America because of John Lewis and those who stood alongside him, that day on March 7th, 1965 and throughout the civil rights journey that we took as a nation. He made an effort, more than an effort.He dedicated his life to nonviolent change. And you often hear him quoted as saying that it was time to get into good trouble. This will take about 10 minutes or so. And in that time, we have an opportunity to talk with those who knew him as we watch this procession. Our reporter, Steve Harrigan, was telling us moments ago that when they reach the peak of this bridge, so about halfway across that 1,200-foot point, they will pause for 60 seconds.The Alabama state troopers back in 1965 on that day, through prejudice and hatred, beat the people on that bridge, tried to beat them back, and tried to beat back their push for a greater America with more freedoms and equality for everybody. They tried to beat them back and beat that out of them. They did not succeed. And we are a better nation now.Again, this will take a few minutes for them to reach the bridge and then cross over to the other side, taking that pause, and we will be here on Fox News to take you through it all.I want to share now though from a perspective on this extraordinary life one of his longtime friends and House colleagues, member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative Emanuel Cleaver. Congressman, you're with me?\n",

      " But we are so deeply blessed to have touched, been touched by his greatness. He will forever change Selma and this nation. On bloody Sunday in 1965, John was confronted by Alabama state troopers and their dogs. They beat him with Billy clubs, fracturing his skull. But John was determined to fight for equality and justice, putting his own life on the line in the service of others and a brighter future for everyone.John crossed bridges so many times, insisting that our nation live up to the ideals upon which it was founded. As he always said, he gave a little blood on that bridge. As always, John was humble. His humility rang true. As he takes his final march, that final crossing, John bridged the gaps that so often divided us, our political parties working everyday for a more just and equitable America.My heart is full knowing that John is crossing that Selma Bridge today in his final march. His final march, that final crossing so different from the first speaks to the legacy that he leaves behind and the lives that he has changed. It's poetic justice that this time Alabama state troopers will see John to his safety. They will accompany him on his last trip over the Selma Bridge and on to Montgomery where he will lie in state at the Capitol.John has left this earth, but his legacy remains on. And we continue to benefit from his life's work. He's laid out the blueprint for us to pick up the baton and continue his march for voting rights, for civil rights, for human rights. John believed firmly that the best days of our nation lie ahead of us. I hope his passing causes us to rededicate ourselves to getting into good trouble, necessary trouble.Can't you hear him? Never give up. Never give in. Keep the faith. Keep your eyes on the prize. For John and our nation, let's make him proud.\n",

So this is the route to the bridge and this is really where you will not see any other vehicles except for those escorting that caisson with John Lewis. And so we have made the turn, if you will. You saw those vehicles pull out of the way and this is relatively a tight space because if you pull out, you'd be able to see the bridge is right there. And as we head into this procession that will eventually reach halfway across the bridge, the peak of it, and take a pause, we will then -- and I'll let you know when it's about to happen -- we will then make every microphone silent. We will not be talking through that. American can take in those moments together.For now, I want to bring in \"The Five\" co-host and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams.

When he comes down that Pettus Bridge, when he pauses there, his hands are in his pockets.He knows what's coming. So there is violence there.

He was a giant of the civil rights movement. And you knew that when you walked into the Capitol for the first time and you look at some of the people that you get to serve with. And yet, John was incredibly approachable.John was such a warm person, and he really did believe in sharing that history. He invited members on a regular basis to go to Selma with him. And I was able to do that in 2016. In fact, my colleague (Inaudible) that just gave those wonderful remarks. We started off at that Brown AME Church, the church where Martin Luther King Jr. would give so many passionate speeches from the pulpit, where John helped organize with other SCLC leaders.The student non-violent coordinating committee which John was the head of, they would meet there at the church. And then ultimately, that day of bloody Sunday, we marched that same route in 2016. And I was honored to be arm in arm with him. And, you know, Harris, as we were walking the long walk, you turn left on Broad Street and you see the Edmund Pettis Bridge.And it just strikes you because I know the history of what happened to John that day. He was brutally beaten crossing that bridge, but he knew what was ahead of him. And yet, he knew that he had to blaze that trail so that others could blaze bigger trails. And as we started down that road and you're looking at the bridge and I'm arm in arm with John, he starts pointing out landmarks.And he said, you know, that's where this group used to meet. And that's where they started organizing against us. And he just remembered that history as if it was yesterday, and he relived it because he wanted others to know that  history as well. And just seeing that history and understanding how far we've come and how far we still want to go as a nation. We've gotten so many of those miles because of great giants like John Lewis.\n",

And I think other members of Congress, you heard Steve Scalise speak in this way, Emanuel Cleaver speak in this way, that John Lewis for all his unassuming manner telling that story.It was like bringing history and the passion to life so that all of us Americans could cheer in the sacrifice that he made that day to make a difference and to bring voting rights because this was about establishing voting rights for black people in the United States to bring voting rights to life.

A strong message has been sent out to young people to stop going to crowded bars and other crowded places. Yesterday, we made the amazing announcement for our plans to protect nursing home residents who are working very hard on that, and we are doing very well all over the country.And also, about contracting with Pfizer, we made a big, big beautiful contract with Pfizer. We think they are very close, but we have a lot of companies that are very close to producing a vaccine. And I wanted to come out again  today to share some additional news with you. This afternoon, my political team came to me and laid out our plans for the convention in Jacksonville, Florida.It's a place I love. I love that state. The drawings looked absolutely beautiful. I never thought we could have something look so good so fast with everything going on. And everything was going well, a tremendous list of speakers, thousands of people wanting to be there. And I mean, in some cases, desperately be there.They wanted to attend. People making traveling all over the country, they wanted to be there. The pageantry, the signs, the excitement were really, really top-of-the-line. But I look to my team and I said the timing for this event is not right, just not right with what's happened recently, the flare-up in Florida. To have a big convention is not the right time. It's really something that for me, I have to protect the American people.That's what I've always done. That's what I always will do. That's what I'm about. They said, sir, we can make this work very easily. We have great enthusiasm, incredible enthusiasm. Even the polls say about the most enthusiasm they've seen. We can do this safely. And we can do this responsibly. And I said there's nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe, whether that's from the China virus or the radical left mob that you see in Portland.I want to thank Homeland Security and others in law enforcement for doing a fantastic job over the last few days. They went in. And people were out of control for 51 days, a long time. And Homeland Security and other law enforcement with us, we went in and they've a great job in protecting our property, federal courthouse and other property, and most importantly protecting our people.Or the senseless violence that you see in Chicago or New York or Detroit, a lot of other cities where so many people were shot and so many people are killed. And people elected me to help them to protect. So I told my team it's time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP convention. We will be starting in North Carolina for the Monday as has always been planned.We were never taking that off. That's remaining as it is. The delegates are going to get together. That's where they do their nomination. So the delegates are going to North Carolina. And they'll be doing the nomination. And we're going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online for the week that we are discussing, which will be really good.I think we're going to do it well. And I'll still do a convention speech in a different form. But we won't do a big, crowded convention per se. It's just not the right time for that. I care deeply about the people of Florida and everywhere else, frankly, in this country and even in the world. We would be coming into the state, and I don't want to do anything to upset it.They will be doing very well, very shortly. We're going to put some maps up over the country behind me, and you will see that the area we are talking about is a hotspot. You will also see a lot of the country has no problem whatsoever, most of the country actually. So I'm always going to take care of you, so that's the way we're going to  do it. I've spoken to Governor DeSantis and informed other political leaders. I want to thank the Jacksonville community, and its great mayor -- he's a great guy, a really great guy, they wanted it so badly -- and all of the other political representatives in Jacksonville and in Florida, just very special people, a very special group, and they were there for us 100 percent.Today I want to provide an update on the actions we're taking to support the safe reopening of America schools. Parents around the world who have had their children home for the last few months have a greater appreciation for the fact that teachers are essential workers, that they're essential to our children's future. Our goal is to protect our teachers and students from the China virus while ensuring that families with high risk factors can continue to participate from home. Very important. The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommending that schools reopen.It said, \"Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in a social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical and sexual abuse, substance abuse, depression, and suicidal ideation. This in turn places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and of some cases, mortality. Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school closures, there's been a substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and for families.\" So that's very important and there's -- either way, it goes both ways.The National Education Association recently stated, despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support. Being at the school, being on the campus is very, very important. One study estimates that due to school closures last spring, the average student will begin the school year roughly 35 percent behind in reading compared to the typical year, and more than 50 percent behind in math. That's a big statement.According to McKinsey & Company, learning loss will probably be greatest among low income Black and Hispanic students. They're the ones that are hit the hardest. We don't want that happening. 30 million American students rely on schools for free and reduced meals. Over 70 percent of the students who receive mental health services do so through their schools.According to HHS, one in five reports allegedly having to do with child abuse. They have neglect, and these neglected cases are submitted by education personnel. So, people in the education world on the premises will be the ones that report neglect and other problems when they see the children. They know if they've been neglected. They know if they've been hurt or harmed in any way, whether it's at home or someplace else, but they see this at school. You don't get to see that if you're not going to school. It's a big thing.Fortunately, the data shows that children are lower risk from the China virus very substantially. When children do contact the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all, and medical complications are exceedingly rare. Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions. 99 percent of all  China virus hospitalizations are adults and 99.96 percent of all fatalities are adults. That means that children are a tiny percentage, less than one percent, and even a small percentage of one percent.In a typical year, the flu results in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States that have been lost thus far to the coronavirus. Many different names. Many, many different names. The life of every child is sacred and must be protected. Our sole focus is the health and wellbeing of America's children.I have a very, very special person who loves children, who's I think one of the greatest athletes of all time. A lot of people say the greatest pitcher of all time. Known as the relief pitcher who could have been whatever he wanted. To some people, he is the greatest reliever of all time by far, substantially more saves than anybody else. In fact, he got the Presidential Medal of Freedom recently, and he -- I'm reading off these stats. I knew he was the best, I knew he was great, but I didn't know it was almost double anybody else.But he's a man who loves children. Has children, loves children, works hard with children. We're going to go outside and be with some little leaguers. Mariano Rivera, you know, he's the Sandman, right? My wife said, \"Darling, why do they call him the Sandman?\" I said, you know, \"They play the song. He just puts the batteries to sleep.\" And that's exactly what happen. So, having Mariano here is a great honor. Thank you very much. I was talking about children and schools, and there's nobody that's done more than you have. Thank you very much, Mariano. Fantastic man.Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers and to protect students. So we do have to protect the teachers and the families also. We have to remember that all families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstance. This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at higher risk.In cities or states that are current hotspots, and you'll see that in the map behind me, districts may need to delay reopening for a few weeks. That's possible. That'll be up to governors. The decision should be made based on the data and the facts on the grounds in each community. But every district should be actively making preparations to open. Again, the children obviously have a very strong immune system, maybe even as strong as yours. They seem to be able to fight it off and not have a problem. So, it's pretty amazing actually. Great, great credit.Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide. As we race toward the completion of a vaccine and therapeutics, the responsible path is to shelter those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk, much lower the case of young children, to resume work at school as long as everyone practices vigilant hygiene and social distancing. We want that.A permanent shutdown was never the strategy, which would ultimately lead to greater mortality and irreversible harms. We don't want to do that. At the same time, we have to get our economy going. We had tremendous numbers issued yesterday, housing prices. Pricing of housing up 21 percent. It's the highest in history. It's the highest number in history. Real estate housing went up 21 percent. Today, the CDC will provide additional guidance for how schools can reopen safely. I hope that local leaders put the full health and wellbeing of their students first and make the right decision for children, parents, teachers, and not make political decisions. This isn't about politics. It's about something very, very important. This is not about politics. I even think it's bad politics if you do the wrong decision, very bad politics.We're asking Congress to provide $105 billion to schools as part of the next Coronavirus Relief bill. This funding will support mitigation measures such as smaller class sizes, more teachers and teacher aids, repurposing spaces to practice social distancing and crucially, mask-wearing. This money is an addition to the $30 billion we secured for schools and universities earlier this year. That money we have, some is distributed and some is not distributed.If schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public, private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice. The key word being choice. If the school is closed, the money should follow the student so the parents and families are in control of their own decisions. So we'd like the money to go to the parents of the student. This way they can make the decision that's best for them.We cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school, harming their mental, physical, and emotional development. Reopening our schools is also critical to ensuring that parents can go to work and provide for their families. The Council of economic advisers estimates that 5.6 million parents will be unable to return to work if schools do not reopen this year. It's a tremendous problem. It's a tremendous problem. Schools have to open safely, but they have to open.More than a dozen European countries, as well as South Korea, Taiwan, and many others have already reopened schools and cases have not risen. We can achieve the same goal if we unite together, follow the best medical practices, and apply common sense.We'll continue to support states and cities and the current hot spots in the south, southwest and west. The governors, I know them all. They're all very, very capable. They're doing a very good job. They're working so hard. You wouldn't even believe it. We have nearly 30,000 federal personnel deployed in the states that need assistance. We're helping with doctors and nurses, medical personnel of all kinds.As a PPE update, we're in close communication with governors and states. We have supplies, everything they could possibly need. We're very strong on supplies. You remember, I used to say the cupboards were bare? Well, now the cupboards are the opposite. Due to our historic efforts to increase both the national stockpile and the state stockpiles, the vast majority of the states have 60 days' worth of supplies on hand. And most importantly, they have ventilators because the ventilators are very, very hard to come by, at least in the past. Now we're making thousands of ventilators a month and supplying them in many cases to other countries.For states that are making requests, we're rapidly delivering. In the last 24 hours, FEMA has the deployed more than 1.5 million masks upon request, 1.7 million gowns, and 600,000, well, let me change that -- we've created about 600,000 different supplies. We have 600 ventilators to Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Colorado,  Idaho, and Washington. I think the number is 600. We're going to check that and we'll give it to you in a little while, but we've got a stockpile of thousands of ventilators. I think we've sent out about 600 just recently.The United States has now conducted more than 51 million tests, which is more than any other country in the world by far. Roughly half of the tests, or either the rapid point of care tests, which frankly solves a lot of problem and delay, five to 15 minutes instead of waiting for service both ways in both directions and then at the lab. But roughly half of them now, which is a tremendous increase, are five to 15-minute tests or tests done in a hospital where you get the results back in less than a day, in some cases immediately.We're continuing to surge testing to current hot spots such as Miami and Phoenix to detect those with the virus and take steps to stop from spreading it further. There's a copy of the map and this is -- you have it right behind me. That's really very much indicating where the problems are. You see from that, it's in great shape, lots of it. The northeast has become very clean. The country is in very good shape, other than if you look south and west, some problems. That'll all work out.On therapies, we've worked with Florida to ensure that over 40,000 vials of Remdesivir are arriving this week. It's a lot. That's a really -- that's a lot. They're working around the clock to make it a tremendous impact. We've also shipped thousands of vials to Arizona, California, and Texas over the past two weeks. Arizona is doing very well. It's heading down. The numbers are heading down I think very quickly. The governor has done a great job. They've all done a great job. They've all done a great job, working hard.We'll continue to monitor the areas rising and with respect to cases, and we ask all Americans to exercise vigilance, practice social distancing, wear a mask, do whatever is necessary so we get rid of this horrible situation, this horrible disease that was sent to us by China. It should not have been sent. They should have stopped it. They could've stopped it. They didn't. And the entire world has gotten infected and a lot of countries are going through a lot right now.This morning, I spoke with President Putin of Russia, and they're going through a very hard time with this in Moscow in particular. I spoke to the Crown Prince Saudi Arabia. They're doing well, but they're going through a lot. Everybody's going through a lot. Yesterday, I spoke to the heads of four different countries. All four are going through a lot, are going through a hard time. This could have been stopped. It could have been stopped quickly and easily, but for some reason it wasn't, and we'll figure out what that reason was.So with that, if you have any questions, please.\n",

      " -- uniting the country in our fight against the China virus. I'm reminding people of the importance of masks when you can't socially distance in particular. A strong message has been sent out to young people to stop going to crowded bars and other crowded places. Yesterday, we made the amazing announcement for our plans to protect nursing home residents who are working very hard on that, and we are doing very well all over the country.And also, about contracting with Pfizer, we made a big, big beautiful contract with Pfizer. We think they are very close, but we have a lot of companies that are very close to producing a vaccine. And I wanted to come out again  today to share some additional news with you. This afternoon, my political team came to me and laid out our plans for the convention in Jacksonville, Florida.It's a place I love. I love that state. The drawings looked absolutely beautiful. I never thought we could have something look so good so fast with everything going on. And everything was going well, a tremendous list of speakers, thousands of people wanting to be there. And I mean, in some cases, desperately be there.They wanted to attend. People making traveling all over the country, they wanted to be there. The pageantry, the signs, the excitement were really, really top-of-the-line. But I look to my team and I said the timing for this event is not right, just not right with what's happened recently, the flare-up in Florida. To have a big convention is not the right time. It's really something that for me, I have to protect the American people.That's what I've always done. That's what I always will do. That's what I'm about. They said, sir, we can make this work very easily. We have great enthusiasm, incredible enthusiasm. Even the polls say about the most enthusiasm they've seen. We can do this safely. And we can do this responsibly. And I said there's nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe, whether that's from the China virus or the radical left mob that you see in Portland.I want to thank Homeland Security and others in law enforcement for doing a fantastic job over the last few days. They went in. And people were out of control for 51 days, a long time. And Homeland Security and other law enforcement with us, we went in and they've a great job in protecting our property, federal courthouse and other property, and most importantly protecting our people.Or the senseless violence that you see in Chicago or New York or Detroit, a lot of other cities where so many people were shot and so many people are killed. And people elected me to help them to protect. So I told my team it's time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP convention. We will be starting in North Carolina for the Monday as has always been planned.We were never taking that off. That's remaining as it is. The delegates are going to get together. That's where they do their nomination. So the delegates are going to North Carolina. And they'll be doing the nomination. And we're going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online for the week that we are discussing, which will be really good.I think we're going to do it well. And I'll still do a convention speech in a different form. But we won't do a big, crowded convention per se. It's just not the right time for that. I care deeply about the people of Florida and everywhere else, frankly, in this country and even in the world. We would be coming into the state, and I don't want to do anything to upset it.They will be doing very well, very shortly. We're going to put some maps up over the country behind me, and you will see that the area we are talking about is a hotspot. You will also see a lot of the country has no problem whatsoever, most of the country actually. So I'm always going to take care of you, so that's the way we're going to  do it. I've spoken to Governor DeSantis and informed other political leaders. I want to thank the Jacksonville community, and its great mayor -- he's a great guy, a really great guy, they wanted it so badly -- and all of the other political representatives in Jacksonville and in Florida, just very special people, a very special group, and they were there for us 100 percent.Today I want to provide an update on the actions we're taking to support the safe reopening of America schools.

And I mean, in some cases, desperately be there.They wanted to attend. People making traveling all over the country, they wanted to be there. The pageantry, the signs, the excitement were really, really top-of-the-line. But I look to my team and I said the timing for this event is not right, just not right with what's happened recently, the flare-up in Florida. To have a big convention is not the right time. It's really something that for me, I have to protect the American people.That's what I've always done. That's what I always will do. That's what I'm about. They said, sir, we can make this work very easily. We have great enthusiasm, incredible enthusiasm. Even the polls say about the most enthusiasm they've seen. We can do this safely. And we can do this responsibly. And I said there's nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe, whether that's from the China virus or the radical left mob that you see in Portland.I want to thank Homeland Security and others in law enforcement for doing a fantastic job over the last few days. They went in. And people were out of control for 51 days, a long time. And Homeland Security and other law enforcement with us, we went in and they've a great job in protecting our property, federal courthouse and other property, and most importantly protecting our people.Or the senseless violence that you see in Chicago or New York or Detroit, a lot of other cities where so many people were shot and so many people are killed. And people elected me to help them to protect. So I told my team it's time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP convention. We will be starting in North Carolina for the Monday as has always been planned.We were never taking that off. That's remaining as it is. The delegates are going to get together. That's where they do their nomination. So the delegates are going to North Carolina. And they'll be doing the nomination. And we're going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online for the week that we are discussing, which will be really good.I think we're going to do it well. And I'll still do a convention speech in a different form. But we won't do a big, crowded convention per se. It's just not the right time for that. I care deeply about the people of Florida and everywhere else, frankly, in this country and even in the world. We would be coming into the state, and I don't want to do anything to upset it.They will be doing very well, very shortly. We're going to put some maps up over the country behind me, and you will see that the area we are talking about is a hotspot. You will also see a lot of the country has no problem whatsoever, most of the country actually. So I'm always going to take care of you, so that's the way we're going to  do it. I've spoken to Governor DeSantis and informed other political leaders. I want to thank the Jacksonville community, and its great mayor -- he's a great guy, a really great guy, they wanted it so badly -- and all of the other political representatives in Jacksonville and in Florida, just very special people, a very special group, and they were there for us 100 percent.Today I want to provide an update on the actions we're taking to support the safe reopening of America schools. Parents around the world who have had their children home for the last few months have a greater appreciation for the fact that teachers are essential workers, that they're essential to our children's future. Our goal is to protect our teachers and students from the China virus while ensuring that families with high risk factors can continue to participate from home. Very important. The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommending that schools reopen.It said, \"Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in a social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical and sexual abuse, substance abuse, depression, and suicidal ideation. This in turn places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and of some cases, mortality. Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school closures, there's been a substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and for families.\" So that's very important and there's -- either way, it goes both ways.The National Education Association recently stated, despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support. Being at the school, being on the campus is very, very important. One study estimates that due to school closures last spring, the average student will begin the school year roughly 35 percent behind in reading compared to the typical year, and more than 50 percent behind in math. That's a big statement.According to McKinsey & Company, learning loss will probably be greatest among low income Black and Hispanic students. They're the ones that are hit the hardest. We don't want that happening. 30 million American students rely on schools for free and reduced meals. Over 70 percent of the students who receive mental health services do so through their schools.According to HHS, one in five reports allegedly having to do with child abuse. They have neglect, and these neglected cases are submitted by education personnel. So, people in the education world on the premises will be the ones that report neglect and other problems when they see the children. They know if they've been neglected. They know if they've been hurt or harmed in any way, whether it's at home or someplace else, but they see this at school. You don't get to see that if you're not going to school. It's a big thing.Fortunately, the data shows that children are lower risk from the China virus very substantially. When children do contact the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all, and medical complications are exceedingly rare. Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions. 99 percent of all  China virus hospitalizations are adults and 99.96 percent of all fatalities are adults. That means that children are a tiny percentage, less than one percent, and even a small percentage of one percent.In a typical year, the flu results in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States that have been lost thus far to the coronavirus. Many different names. Many, many different names. The life of every child is sacred and must be protected. Our sole focus is the health and wellbeing of America's children.I have a very, very special person who loves children, who's I think one of the greatest athletes of all time. A lot of people say the greatest pitcher of all time. Known as the relief pitcher who could have been whatever he wanted. To some people, he is the greatest reliever of all time by far, substantially more saves than anybody else. In fact, he got the Presidential Medal of Freedom recently, and he -- I'm reading off these stats. I knew he was the best, I knew he was great, but I didn't know it was almost double anybody else.But he's a man who loves children. Has children, loves children, works hard with children. We're going to go outside and be with some little leaguers. Mariano Rivera, you know, he's the Sandman, right? My wife said, \"Darling, why do they call him the Sandman?\" I said, you know, \"They play the song. He just puts the batteries to sleep.\" And that's exactly what happen. So, having Mariano here is a great honor. Thank you very much. I was talking about children and schools, and there's nobody that's done more than you have. Thank you very much, Mariano. Fantastic man.Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers and to protect students. So we do have to protect the teachers and the families also. We have to remember that all families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstance. This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at higher risk.In cities or states that are current hotspots, and you'll see that in the map behind me, districts may need to delay reopening for a few weeks. That's possible. That'll be up to governors. The decision should be made based on the data and the facts on the grounds in each community. But every district should be actively making preparations to open. Again, the children obviously have a very strong immune system, maybe even as strong as yours. They seem to be able to fight it off and not have a problem. So, it's pretty amazing actually. Great, great credit.Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide. As we race toward the completion of a vaccine and therapeutics, the responsible path is to shelter those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk, much lower the case of young children, to resume work at school as long as everyone practices vigilant hygiene and social distancing. We want that.A permanent shutdown was never the strategy, which would ultimately lead to greater mortality and irreversible harms. We don't want to do that. At the same time, we have to get our economy going. We had tremendous numbers issued yesterday, housing prices. Pricing of housing up 21 percent. It's the highest in history. It's the highest number in history. Real estate housing went up 21 percent. Today, the CDC will provide additional guidance for how schools can reopen safely. I hope that local leaders put the full health and wellbeing of their students first and make the right decision for children, parents, teachers, and not make political decisions. This isn't about politics. It's about something very, very important. This is not about politics. I even think it's bad politics if you do the wrong decision, very bad politics.We're asking Congress to provide $105 billion to schools as part of the next Coronavirus Relief bill. This funding will support mitigation measures such as smaller class sizes, more teachers and teacher aids, repurposing spaces to practice social distancing and crucially, mask-wearing. This money is an addition to the $30 billion we secured for schools and universities earlier this year. That money we have, some is distributed and some is not distributed.If schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public, private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice. The key word being choice. If the school is closed, the money should follow the student so the parents and families are in control of their own decisions. So we'd like the money to go to the parents of the student. This way they can make the decision that's best for them.We cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school, harming their mental, physical, and emotional development. Reopening our schools is also critical to ensuring that parents can go to work and provide for their families. The Council of economic advisers estimates that 5.6 million parents will be unable to return to work if schools do not reopen this year. It's a tremendous problem. It's a tremendous problem. Schools have to open safely, but they have to open.More than a dozen European countries, as well as South Korea, Taiwan, and many others have already reopened schools and cases have not risen. We can achieve the same goal if we unite together, follow the best medical practices, and apply common sense.We'll continue to support states and cities and the current hot spots in the south, southwest and west. The governors, I know them all. They're all very, very capable. They're doing a very good job. They're working so hard. You wouldn't even believe it. We have nearly 30,000 federal personnel deployed in the states that need assistance. We're helping with doctors and nurses, medical personnel of all kinds.As a PPE update, we're in close communication with governors and states. We have supplies, everything they could possibly need. We're very strong on supplies. You remember, I used to say the cupboards were bare? Well, now the cupboards are the opposite. Due to our historic efforts to increase both the national stockpile and the state stockpiles, the vast majority of the states have 60 days' worth of supplies on hand. And most importantly, they have ventilators because the ventilators are very, very hard to come by, at least in the past. Now we're making thousands of ventilators a month and supplying them in many cases to other countries.For states that are making requests, we're rapidly delivering. In the last 24 hours, FEMA has the deployed more than 1.5 million masks upon request, 1.7 million gowns, and 600,000, well, let me change that -- we've created about 600,000 different supplies. We have 600 ventilators to Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Colorado,  Idaho, and Washington. I think the number is 600. We're going to check that and we'll give it to you in a little while, but we've got a stockpile of thousands of ventilators. I think we've sent out about 600 just recently.The United States has now conducted more than 51 million tests, which is more than any other country in the world by far. Roughly half of the tests, or either the rapid point of care tests, which frankly solves a lot of problem and delay, five to 15 minutes instead of waiting for service both ways in both directions and then at the lab. But roughly half of them now, which is a tremendous increase, are five to 15-minute tests or tests done in a hospital where you get the results back in less than a day, in some cases immediately.We're continuing to surge testing to current hot spots such as Miami and Phoenix to detect those with the virus and take steps to stop from spreading it further. There's a copy of the map and this is -- you have it right behind me. That's really very much indicating where the problems are. You see from that, it's in great shape, lots of it. The northeast has become very clean. The country is in very good shape, other than if you look south and west, some problems. That'll all work out.On therapies, we've worked with Florida to ensure that over 40,000 vials of Remdesivir are arriving this week. It's a lot. That's a really -- that's a lot. They're working around the clock to make it a tremendous impact. We've also shipped thousands of vials to Arizona, California, and Texas over the past two weeks. Arizona is doing very well. It's heading down. The numbers are heading down I think very quickly. The governor has done a great job. They've all done a great job. They've all done a great job, working hard.We'll continue to monitor the areas rising and with respect to cases, and we ask all Americans to exercise vigilance, practice social distancing, wear a mask, do whatever is necessary so we get rid of this horrible situation, this horrible disease that was sent to us by China. It should not have been sent. They should have stopped it. They could've stopped it. They didn't. And the entire world has gotten infected and a lot of countries are going through a lot right now.This morning, I spoke with President Putin of Russia, and they're going through a very hard time with this in Moscow in particular. I spoke to the Crown Prince Saudi Arabia. They're doing well, but they're going through a lot. Everybody's going through a lot. Yesterday, I spoke to the heads of four different countries. All four are going through a lot, are going through a hard time. This could have been stopped. It could have been stopped quickly and easily, but for some reason it wasn't, and we'll figure out what that reason was.So with that, if you have any questions, please.\n",
